# Stakeholders

There will be multiple stakeholders in UncleMine ecosystem:

* **Miners** — In the definition of UncleMine, miners do not specifically refer to digital currency miners such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but a broad resource provider group. All people who provide various resources and computing power assets for the smart contract ecosystem through UncleMine are miners in the UM ecosystem.
* **UM Validators** — Run UMVL nodes to provide computing capabilities for verifying various computing power (such as zero-knowledge proof generation services) to ensure that the computing power certification is continuously updated and provide data services to the contract on the chain.
* **Community and developers** — Community members and developers will jointly determine the development direction of the network according to UMDAO's rules, and realize self-correction and upgrade of the network.
* **Users**—Users who use various DeFi/GameFi/DApp based on proof of computing power.
