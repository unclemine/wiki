# UMAL (Application Layer)

Besides the native token, UM, there are also two types of NFTs. **Computing power NFT** is the most unique digital asset in the UncleMine ecosystem, and can only be minted through the proof of computing power provided by the UncleMine protocol. The computing power NFT represents the computing power resources that actually exist in the physical world, which is guaranteed by UncleMine's cryptographic scheme to be true and effective.&#x20;



The computing power NFT can be used in the UncleMine ecosystem and other related DeFi applications, such as using computing power NFT for token issuance and fundraising (IMO), using multiple computing power NFTs to form a decentralized mining pool, and using computing power NFT as collateral to borrow other assets in DeFi lending applications. The value of computing power NFT itself will continue to be tapped with the development of the UncleMine ecology, exceeding the value of computing power in the physical world.
